        <h1>Class Review</h1>
        <p>When this class started, I was expecting to just do coding the entire time. Now that the semester's almost over and we've done a lot of coding, it feels refreshing to know that I've learned so much about coding than I thought I ever would. I liked the times when I was able to figure out how to make certian codes, on my own. It was pretty frustrating to figure things out that I had no previous knowledge on, but for the most part, I got through it. After this class, I would not do computer science in college, but I'm glad it's something I experienced.</p>
