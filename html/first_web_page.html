            <h2>Listening to music, to concentrate.</h2>
            <p>I listen to music, not just when I go on walks. Working in silence gets stops me from focusing, because it just feels too quiet. I can't listen to music that I usually listen to when I'm studying, because it can get distracting. Having a background noise helps me to focus on whatever I'm working on. It helps when teachers play music during worktime."</p>

            <h3>Taking walks with music.</h3>
            <p>I enjoy walking around random places. It's way better to have music, than walking with no sound. I don't have to work about anyone bothering or talking to me. It's calming to walk near the river, or around busy areas. Sometimes I like to take my sister with me, for some company.</p>

        <p>As you now know, I love listening to my playlists. It sucks once the playlist ends and random songs come on. They either become my favorite, or most hated song. Never will I ever willingly listen to Taylor Swift, Cotton Eye Joe, and just any music like those.</p>
